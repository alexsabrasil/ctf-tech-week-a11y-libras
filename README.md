# Accessibility (A11y) in Clean RESTful APIs

Discover how to combine the concepts of Clean Architecture with the Speech-To-Text (STT) concept to promote accessibility for audible educational content and harness the power of Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB in building a RESTful API focused on accurate audio transcription.

## Hands-On Overview

The Audio2Text project is an advanced system designed to transcribe audio content into text format, leveraging the power of OpenAI's API for high-quality transcriptions. The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and well-organized codebase.

## Project Structure and References

This project's architecture is inspired by and references several key sources in Clean Architecture and software design. The structure is visualized using a mermaid graph for clarity.

## Development Demands (TODOs)

Our development team has outlined several key TODOs for further implementation and integration:

### Environment Setup

`TODO 1: Verify and set up the necessary environment variables for the project operation.`

### Integration with OpenAI API to High-Quality Transcription

`TODO 2: Implement the TranscriptionService contract to consume the "audio/transcription" endpoint of the OpenAI API.`

`TODO 3: Orchestrate the integration of the transcription service within the application flow.`

## Accessibility Showcase:

`TODO 4: Use the JavaScript Fetch API to consume the "/transcribed-audios/{id}" endpoint and display the transcript in the front-end.`

`TODO 5: Integrate with VLibras to provide accessibility support for Brazilian Sign Language translation.`
